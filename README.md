# Botany Buddy

**This app is made to grow a virtual plant. Users must "plant a seed", then click on a watering can or sunshine to make it grow.**

## Planned Future Enhancements

I would like to add a second level where the flower changes colors based on water and sun intake.

I would like to add multiple types of flowers that get randomly generated on planting. 

I would like to add some time elapse functionality where the user has to come check on the plant's condition.
